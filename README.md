## Calorie Tracker(Food/Exercise)

The project that we are planning to design involves tracking. To get into the specifics it will include the tracking of calories gained from food, and calories lost from exercise. We will be having a vast catalog of food based on public information(if this is allowed) that allows the user to input ingredients, popular foods, and give the user access to create their own custom meal to put it all together. Otherwise, we will have the user input all the nutrition labels and serving sizes themselves, which will then be saved to our database. The food aspect of this tracker uses the weight of the given item to calculate carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and just about anything that you would see on a food label. As for the exercise aspect, we will be including a catalog of workouts that can roughly estimate the amount of calories burned based on the time worked out. Once all the calories lost/gained are calculated the project will ultimately showcase the amount of calories eaten, lost(separate from the calories eaten), and go into the logistics of the food consumed all put together for the given day.
